        <h1><img src="WCA.png" width=10%>WCA competitions</h1>
        <p>WCA Competitions are official competitions that post your scores onto the internet, and are kept as official
            records by the WCA, unlike our club-only DHS competitions. WCA Comps can be difficult to organize, as the
            closest ones to Davis are always in Sacramento or San Francisco, and there is also a fee to get into the
            competition. To sucessfully attend a competition, we will need to fundraise money for the competition fees,
            gas, and the toll roads (for SanFransisco bridges) in advance, meet early in the morning at a DHS parking
            lot, and have us all pile into as few vehicles as possible (to save gas) to drive over.
            To furthur complicate matters, most cubing competitions donâ€™t have all WCA cubing events. This means that
            you may be able to compete in 3x3 in a competition, but you cannot compete in 7x7. In some extreme cases,
            the common 3x3 event is not availible, but less common events such as megaminx and square-1 are availible
            instead. Knowing all of the above, we have drafted the following criteria for selecting a cube competition
            that our club will attend:
            <ol>
                <li>Must be less than 100 miles from Davis (San Fransisco, Sacramento)</li>
                <li>Must have 3x3 as an availible event</li>
                <li>Must be on a Saturday or Sunday (So as to not miss school)</li>
                <li>Must have at least 3 of the following events: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>4x4</li> 
                        <li>5x5</li>  
                        <li>6x6</li>  
                        <li>7x7</li>  
                        <li>Square-1</li>  
                        <li>Pyraminx</li> 
                        <li>Skewb</li> 

                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            While difficult to pull off, attending official competitions is a great experience for everyone in the
            cubing club, and it will help members get integrated in the California cubing community, and also get their
            scores posted online for everyone to see (which you can show to people if you did well).
        </p>
        <p>WCA scores can be viewed here on the <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/">WCA website</a>.</p>

        <p>Participation in DHS competitions are mandatory for all DHS Cube Alliance members. The rules are the same as
            WCA competitions, only that records will not be honored by the WCA. All event scores are recorded for the
            club data, and will be posted on the CubeAlliance website unless you ask that we don't. Even if you are not
            having your scores posted on the CubeAlliance website, we still ask for full effort in the competition.</p>
